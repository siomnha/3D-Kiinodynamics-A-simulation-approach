# 3D-Kiinodynamics-A-simulation-approach

This project provide a basic tutorial applying 3D kinodynamics A* algorithm developed by https://github.com/ItsNotSoftware/nav6d.


After building the packages, it allows you to: 

Run the algorithm in Rviz

Pre-defined multiple waypoints your UAV want to travel

Visualize the flight path 



The packages are still in development and aim to replace original PD controller to ardupilot PID controller and add CraneAero model into the simulation
